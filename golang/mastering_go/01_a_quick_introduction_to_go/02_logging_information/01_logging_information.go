		The log package of the standard Go library does not support working with logging levels.
		The log package sends log messages to standard error.
		By default log writes to standard error, the use of log.SetOutput() modifies that behavior.

		Writing to the main system log file is as easy as calling syslog.New() with the syslog.LOG_SYSLOG option.
		After that you need to tell your Go program that all logging information goes to the new loggerâ€”this is
		implemented with a call to the log.SetOutput() function.
