		A `goroutine` is the smallest executable Go entity. In order to create a new goroutine,
		you have to use the go keyword followed by a predefined function or an anonymous function.

		A `channel` in Go is a mechanism that, among other things, allows goroutines to
		communicate and exchange data.

		Although it is easy to create goroutines, there are other difficulties when dealing with
		concurrent programming including:
			- goroutine synchronization
			- sharing data between goroutine

		The main() runs as a goroutine and you do not want main() to finish before the other goroutines
		of the program because when main() exits, the entire program along with any goroutines that
		have not finished yet will terminate.

		This happens because goroutines are initialized in random order and start running in random order.
		The Go scheduler is responsible for the execution of goroutines just like the OS scheduler is
		responsible for the execution of the OS threads.
		Chapter 7 presents the solution to that randomness issue with the use of a sync.WaitGroup variable.
